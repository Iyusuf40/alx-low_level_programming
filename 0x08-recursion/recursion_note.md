KEY CONCEPTS

1. Recursed program run till the end of the original function each time it is recursed, hence it returns each time for each recurse ie if there is a return value and prints if there is anything to be printed.

2. Hence, the returned value can be saved in a variable.

3. If the return value is not saved incrementally as in <res += recursion_func(a, z)>, the last itearation is always returned/saved.
